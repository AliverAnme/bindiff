// Special algorithm that is only used for functions with matched parents
// (callers). The point of the call at the call site is determined as a tuple:
// topological basic block level, instruction number in the basic block,
// address. The child function (callee) is matched if basic block level and
// instruction number match (exact), if only the basic block level match
// (topology) or simply ordered by call site address (sequence). This produces
// very weak matches in general, but may be a good strategy if the parent
// function was matched correctly. In that case it is not unlikely that it will
// call functions in the same order in both binaries.
